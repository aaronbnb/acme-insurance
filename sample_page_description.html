    asterisk to the right of them. The third field has a formatting hint below it. When the form is submitted, invalid
    fields are indicated through a red border.</p>
  <h3>Additional details</h3>
  <p>This section contains the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A radio button group containing three radio buttons. Above them is a group label with the text "Preferred
      Contact Method". The radio buttons are labeled "By phone", "By mail", and "By letter".</li>
    <li>A submit button. When the form is submitted without errors, a toast message appears at the top of the screen for
      a few seconds. The toast message reads "We will respond within 24 hours. Your ticket number is 43556322". The
      number at the end is a link.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When the form is submitted without selecting a radio button, red warning text will appear above the radio group
    urging the user to make a selection. Selecting a radio button dynamically changes the contents of the rest of the
    form section, described in in more detail below.</p>

  <h4>By Phone</h4>
  <p>If the "by phone" option is selected, the following fields will appear below the radio group:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A text field labeled "phone number". The field has a formatting hint below the field.</li>
    <li>
      A select list labeled "phone type".
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>By Email</h4>
  <p>If the "by email" option is selected, the following fields will appear below the radio group:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A text field labeled "email address".</li>
    <li>
      A button labeled "send a copy". The button can be toggled on or off, which is visually indicated by a checkmark
      next to the button label.
    </li>
    <li>A textfield labeled "Email Address to Copy". When the "send a copy" button is not pressed, this field looks
      faded can cannot receive focus by clicking on it.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>By Letter</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>A text field labeled "Street address".</li>
    <li>
      A button labeled "More Address Details". The button functions as a toggle button that shows or hides two extra
      fields: "zip code" and "city". Toggling the button does not change its visual appearance.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Footer</h2>
  <p>The page footer is styled with a dark gray background and semi-transparent white text and icons (which appears as a
    light gray color). The footer contains four columns, each of which contains a small heading and a list of links. The
    second column contains social media icons in the last list item.</p>

  <h2>Sticky footer</h2>
  <p>There is a permanently visible sticky footer that is fixed to the bottom of the screen, regardless of scrolling
    position. This sticky footer contains an icon of an alarm bell, and the text "Don't miss out! Only 1 week left in
    our annual sale! Click here to find out more". The word "here" is a link. The background color is aqua, the text
    color is white, and the link color is yellow.</p>

  <h2>Responsive behavior</h2>
  <p>On smaller screens or larger browser zooming levels, the following responsive changes occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The navigation menu is hidden. Instead, there is a so called "hamburger" menu button (a button icon with three
      horiontal lines). This button can be used to expand or collapse the navigation menu.
    </li>
    <li>Sections that were laid out side by side are not laid out as a single column.</li>
    <li>Carousel slides no longer show their textual contents, just the stock photos.</li>
  </ul>
